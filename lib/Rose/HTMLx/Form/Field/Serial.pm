Rose::HTMLx::Form::Field::Serial - represent auto-increment columns in a form

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # see Rose::HTML::Form::Field::Hidden

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Rose::HTMLx::Form::Field::Serial is a subclass of Rose::HTML::Form::Field::Hidden.
It exists simply to isolate a particular kind of form field that should
not be updated via form but may need to be passed as a param or viewed
in a (x)html serialized format. The namespace is reserved in the event that future
functionality may be added, but mostly to uniquely identify this field type
for use with Rose::DBx::Garden.
 
=head1 METHODS

Currently no methods are overridden.
